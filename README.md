# jsroot_ex


To set up this short example:

```
git clone https://github.com/sezata/jsroot_ex.git
cd jsroot_ex
```

Then install jsroot, instructions are here: https://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/guides/JSROOT/JSROOT.html

Your folder should look like:

```
files  jsroot  README.md  test.html
```

Open and edit the line in test.html which says `https://anwang.web.cern.ch/anwang/jsroot_ex/jsroot` to point to your repository path. For example, this is the web path corresponding to `/eos/user/a/anwang/www/jsroot_ex/jsroot` in my local area. 

Open the test.html file in your browser.
